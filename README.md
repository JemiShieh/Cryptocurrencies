# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

## Cryptocurrencies Analysis Overview
Create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.

Process the dataset to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output, use an unsupervised learning clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies. Use data visualizations to share the results.

The analysis includes the following steps:
* Preprocessing the Data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
